# Custom API Form Processing for Maplewood Hearth & Home

## Overview
This document outlines advanced form processing options beyond basic Netlify form handling, focusing on intelligent business logic and automated workflows for the fireplace business.

## Current Implementation
- **Basic Setup**: Netlify form with `data-netlify="true"`
- **Redirect**: Form submits to `/thank-you/` page
- **Notification**: Email notifications via Netlify dashboard
- **Integration**: HTTP POST requests to external services

## Advanced Custom API Processing Options

### 1. Intelligent Lead Scoring & Routing

#### Business Logic Examples
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for intelligent form processing
function processContactForm(formData) {
  const leadScore = calculateLeadScore(formData);
  const urgency = determineUrgency(formData);
  const serviceType = formData.service;
  
  // Route based on business rules
  if (urgency === 'emergency') {
    notifyTechnicians(formData, 'immediate');
    sendSMS(formData.phone, 'Emergency response dispatched');
  } else if (serviceType === 'fireplace-installation') {
    assignToSalesTeam(formData);
    scheduleFollowUp(formData, '24-hours');
  } else if (serviceType === 'consultation') {
    addToSchedulingQueue(formData);
    sendCalendlyLink(formData.email);
  }
}
```

#### Lead Scoring Factors
- **Service Type**: Installation (high value) vs. cleaning (standard)
- **Message Content**: Keywords like "urgent", "emergency", "new construction"
- **Contact Method**: Phone + email (higher intent) vs. email only
- **Time of Submission**: Business hours vs. after hours
- **Geographic Location**: Service area proximity

### 2. Seasonal Intelligence

#### Winter Season (Oct-Mar)
- **Priority Services**: Emergency repairs, chimney cleaning
- **Automated Responses**: "Winter safety checklist" email series
- **Routing**: Higher priority to maintenance team

#### Spring/Summer (Apr-Sep)
- **Priority Services**: Installations, renovations
- **Automated Responses**: "Planning your fireplace project" guide
- **Routing**: Sales team for project planning

### 3. Personalized Follow-up Automation

#### Service-Specific Workflows
```javascript
const followUpWorkflows = {
  'fireplace-installation': {
    immediate: 'Installation consultation scheduling',
    day1: 'Project planning guide',
    week1: 'Financing options overview',
    month1: 'Check-in on decision timeline'
  },
  'chimney-cleaning': {
    immediate: 'Service scheduling options',
    day1: 'Preparation checklist',
    week1: 'Maintenance tips',
    year1: 'Annual service reminder'
  },
  'emergency': {
    immediate: 'Technician dispatch confirmation',
    hour1: 'ETA update',
    day1: 'Service completion follow-up',
    week1: 'Preventive maintenance recommendations'
  }
};
```

### 4. Business Analytics & Insights

#### Automated Reporting
- **Lead Source Tracking**: Which pages generate most inquiries
- **Conversion Metrics**: Form submission to appointment booking rates
- **Service Demand Patterns**: Seasonal trends and capacity planning
- **Response Time Analytics**: Average time to first contact

#### Dashboard Metrics
```javascript
const businessMetrics = {
  dailyLeads: calculateDailySubmissions(),
  conversionRate: calculateFormToSale(),
  averageResponseTime: calculateResponseMetrics(),
  seasonalTrends: analyzeServiceDemand(),
  customerSatisfaction: trackFollowUpResponses()
};
```
