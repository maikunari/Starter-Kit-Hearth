As Cedar Falls' trusted fireplace experts for over 25 years, we at Maplewood Hearth & Home have seen firsthand how proper safety practices can prevent accidents and keep families safe. Whether you have a wood-burning fireplace, gas insert, or electric unit, following these essential safety tips will help you enjoy your fireplace with peace of mind.

## Annual Chimney Inspection and Cleaning

The most important safety practice is having your chimney professionally inspected and cleaned at least once a year. Here's why this matters:

- **Creosote buildup** from wood burning can ignite and cause chimney fires
- **Animal nests or debris** can block proper ventilation
- **Structural damage** to the chimney liner can allow dangerous gases to enter your home
- **Carbon monoxide** can accumulate if the flue isn't drawing properly

At Maplewood Hearth & Home, our certified chimney sweeps follow National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards to ensure your chimney is safe and efficient.

## Proper Fireplace Operation

### Before Starting a Fire:
- Open the damper fully before lighting
- Check that the flue is clear by looking up with a flashlight
- Ensure the fireplace screen is in place
- Keep the area around the fireplace clear of flammable materials

### During Operation:
- Never leave a fire unattended
- Use only seasoned hardwood (oak, maple, ash) that has been dried for at least 6 months
- Avoid burning treated wood, cardboard, or trash
- Keep the glass doors open while burning (for wood-burning fireplaces)
- Monitor children and pets around the fireplace

### After the Fire:
- Allow ashes to cool completely (at least 12 hours)
- Store cold ashes in a metal container with a tight lid, away from combustible materials
- Close the damper only after the fire is completely extinguished and cool

## Gas Fireplace Safety

Gas fireplaces require different safety considerations:

- Have gas connections inspected annually by a qualified technician
- Check for gas leaks by smell (rotten egg odor) or with soapy water on connections
- Ensure proper ventilation is maintained
- Keep the glass doors closed during operation
- Never use the fireplace if you smell gas

## Install and Maintain Safety Equipment

Every home with a fireplace should have:

- **Smoke detectors** on every level and in sleeping areas
- **Carbon monoxide detectors** near sleeping areas and on every level
- **Fire extinguisher** rated for Class A fires
- **Fireplace screen** to prevent sparks from escaping

Test all detectors monthly and replace batteries annually.

## Emergency Preparedness

Know what to do in case of a chimney fire:

1. Call 911 immediately
2. Get everyone out of the house
3. If safe to do so, close the damper and glass doors to cut off oxygen
4. Use a Class A fire extinguisher on small fires only if you can do so safely

## Professional Maintenance Matters

- Comprehensive chimney inspections using video technology
- Professional cleaning with specialized equipment

## Seasonal Safety Reminders

### Fall Preparation:
- Schedule annual chimney cleaning before first use
- Check fireplace tools and screens for damage
- Stock up on seasoned firewood
- Test smoke and carbon monoxide detectors

### Winter Operation:
- Monitor weather conditions that might affect draft

### Spring Maintenance:
- Close damper to prevent animals from entering
